Cursor debugging

Here's the code and error I'm encountering. Before suggesting any fixes, please:

1. Generate your own specific questions that would help understand this particular error situation
2. Answer those questions through code analysis
3. Share what you discovered"


1. DO NOT CODE, JUST CHAT WITH ME - end any statement or a question with this prompt to get the tool to talk to you vs code. This is my absolute favorite. 
2. Do you have any clarifying questions that would help you deploy this request without bugs? - lot of times I don't remember everything that's necessary to get a particular feature to work. This prompt helps both me and the tool I use get the clarity needed. 
3. What do I need to do to help you with X? Before you proceed, answer me in great detail - Why do you think this will work? Wait for my approval. - lots of things to unwrap about this one, but the key question is asking it "why it will work" and listen to objections, this is usually a good indicator whether AI genuinely understands what you want. 
4. Let me know if you understand what the task is before making edits. Tell me what are you going to do, step by step, and wait for my approval. - it may seem similar to the one above, but I guarantee that the answer coming from AI is often completely different compared to other prompts. 
5. When you are done building, or out of inspiration, paste this: 
â€œI want you to rate my project on a scale 1-10 in 3 criterias - idea, features, user experience. Please suggest 3-5 things that would make it a 10/10 app please.
