# Deployment Guide

This document provides detailed instructions for building and deploying the Deployment Analyzer application.

## Quick Start Guide for Continuous Deployment

Follow these exact steps to build and ship a new version of the Deployment Analyzer:

### 1. Prepare Your Environment

```powershell
# Install or update required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Clean previous builds
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Path build, dist, *.spec
```

### 2. Build the Application (Choose ONE method)

#### Method A: Comprehensive Build (Recommended)
```powershell
# Run the ultimate build script that handles everything
.\ultimate_build.bat
```

#### Method B: Enhanced Build with Optimizations
```powershell
# Run the enhanced build with optimizations
.\enhanced_build.bat
```

#### Method C: Manual Build
```powershell
# Standard PyInstaller build
.\build.bat
```

### 3. Create the Final Distribution

```powershell
# Create the clean, user-friendly distribution
.\create_final_release.bat
# IMPORTANT: When prompted for EXE launcher, always select 'Y' to create an executable launcher
# This ensures only the EXE file is visible in the top directory for better user experience
```

### 4. Verify the Build

```powershell
# Test the application directly
.\dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release\DeploymentAnalyzer.exe

# Or use the debug launcher for more detailed output
.\dist\DeploymentAnalyzer\debug_launcher.bat
```

### 5. Package for Distribution

```powershell
# Create a zip archive of the release
Compress-Archive -Path .\dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release -DestinationPath .\dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release.zip -Force
```

### 6. Common Issues & Quick Fixes

- **Missing files in build**: Check `verify_results.txt` in the lib directory
- **Application won't start**: Run the debug launcher to see error messages
- **Build script fails**: Make sure Python environment variables are correctly set
- **Large build size**: Use `update_release_with_exe.bat` to clean up unnecessary files

## Building the Application

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- PyInstaller 6.0 or higher
- Required Python packages (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Windows environment with PowerShell or Command Prompt

### Step 1: Clean Previous Builds

```powershell
# In PowerShell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Path build, dist, *.spec
```

or in Command Prompt:

```cmd
rmdir /s /q build dist
del *.spec
```

### Step 2: Build the Application

There are multiple ways to build the application, each with different features and optimizations:

#### Option 1: Use the Ultimate Build Script (Recommended)

This is the most comprehensive build method that handles all dependencies and optimizations:

```powershell
.\ultimate_build.bat
```

The ultimate build script:
- Automatically detects and includes all required Python dependencies
- Copies necessary DLL files to ensure compatibility across systems
- Excludes test files and large sample data to reduce size
- Creates verification files and debug launchers
- Handles edge cases and common build issues automatically

#### Option 2: Use the Enhanced Build Script

If you need more control over the build process:

```powershell
.\enhanced_build.bat
```

The enhanced build script includes:
- Custom PyInstaller options
- Specific DLL inclusions
- File exclusion patterns for optimization

#### Option 3: Standard PyInstaller Commands

```powershell
# For directory-based build (recommended for testing)
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onedir --windowed --add-data "data;data" --add-data "logs;logs" --add-data "output;output" --add-data "deployment-analyse.py;." --name "DeploymentAnalyzer" launcher.py

# For single executable (final distribution)
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --add-data "data;data" --add-data "logs;logs" --add-data "output;output" --add-data "deployment-analyse.py;." --name "DeploymentAnalyzer" launcher.py
```

### Step 3: Create a Clean Distribution (Recommended)

After building the application with one of the methods above, create a clean, user-friendly distribution:

```powershell
# Creates a clean distribution with only visible files the user needs
.\create_final_release.bat

# When prompted for an EXE launcher instead of BAT, type 'Y' for better user experience
```

This creates a distribution in `dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release` with the following features:
- Only two visible files: `DeploymentAnalyzer.exe` (launcher) and `README.txt`
- All application files hidden in the `.app` folder
- Proper configuration and directory structure

**Important**: The `create_final_release.bat` script looks for source distributions in this priority order:
1. `dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Final`
2. `dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Perfect`
3. `dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Ultimate`
4. `dist\DeploymentAnalyzer` (default location)

Make sure one of these exists before running the script.

## Complete Build Process Workflow

For consistent and reliable builds, follow this workflow:

1. **Update source code** as needed for the new version
2. **Update version numbers** in:
   - `deployment-analyse.py` (VERSION constant)
   - `README.md` and `README.txt`
   - Any other version-specific files

3. **Clean previous builds**:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Path build, dist, *.spec
   ```

4. **Build the core application**:
   ```powershell
   .\ultimate_build.bat
   # or .\enhanced_build.bat for more control
   ```

5. **Create the final release**:
   ```powershell
   .\create_final_release.bat
   # Answer 'Y' to create EXE launcher
   ```

6. **Test the release**:
   - Test directly: `.\dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release\DeploymentAnalyzer.exe`
   - Test with debug info: `.\dist\DeploymentAnalyzer\debug_launcher.bat`

7. **Create distribution package**:
   ```powershell
   Compress-Archive -Path .\dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release -DestinationPath .\dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release.zip -Force
   ```

8. **Verify distribution size**:
   - Should be approximately 330-350 MB
   - If significantly larger, run cleanup:
     ```powershell
     .\update_release_with_exe.bat
     ```

9. **Document changes** in a release notes file

## Improved Deployment Process

If you encounter issues with the standard deployment process above, use this improved process which ensures all required files and directories are correctly included in the release:

### 1. Create and Use a Fix Release Script

Create a file named `fix_release.bat` with the following content:

```batch

### 2. Alternative Approach: Create a VBS to EXE Launcher

If the C# compiler (`csc`) method in the fix script above fails, use this alternative launcher approach:

1. Create a file named `create_launcher.bat`:

```batch
@echo off
echo Creating a shortcut with .exe extension...

echo Set oWS = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell") > CreateShortcut.vbs
echo sLinkFile = "dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release\DeploymentAnalyzer.exe.lnk" >> CreateShortcut.vbs
echo Set oLink = oWS.CreateShortcut(sLinkFile) >> CreateShortcut.vbs
echo oLink.TargetPath = "wscript.exe" >> CreateShortcut.vbs
echo oLink.Arguments = "//nologo " ^& Chr(34) ^& "dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release\DeploymentAnalyzer.vbs" ^& Chr(34) >> CreateShortcut.vbs
echo oLink.Description = "Deployment Analyzer" >> CreateShortcut.vbs
echo oLink.WindowStyle = 0 >> CreateShortcut.vbs
echo oLink.WorkingDirectory = "dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release" >> CreateShortcut.vbs
echo oLink.IconLocation = "shell32.dll,167" >> CreateShortcut.vbs
echo oLink.Save >> CreateShortcut.vbs

cscript //nologo CreateShortcut.vbs
del CreateShortcut.vbs

echo Moving the .lnk file to replace .exe...
ren "dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release\DeploymentAnalyzer.exe.lnk" "DeploymentAnalyzer.exe"

echo Launcher created at:
echo dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release\DeploymentAnalyzer.exe
echo.
echo Done!
pause
```

2. Or as a simpler fallback option, directly copy the VBS file as an EXE:

```powershell
copy "dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release\DeploymentAnalyzer.vbs" "dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release\DeploymentAnalyzer.exe"
```

### 3. Step-by-Step Guide for Reliable Deployment

1. **Prepare the Environment**:
   ```powershell
   # Install or update required packages
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Clean previous builds
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Path build, dist, *.spec
   ```

2. **Build the Basic Application**:
   ```powershell
   # Run PyInstaller to create the base distribution
   pyinstaller --noconfirm --onedir --windowed --add-data "data;data" --add-data "logs;logs" --add-data "output;output" --add-data "deployment-analyse.py;." --name "DeploymentAnalyzer" launcher.py
   ```

3. **Create the Fixed Release**:
   ```powershell
   # Run the custom fix script
   .\fix_release.bat
   ```

4. **Test the Distribution**:
   ```powershell
   # Test the application
   .\dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release\DeploymentAnalyzer.exe
   ```

5. **Package the Distribution**:
   ```powershell
   # Create a zip archive
   Compress-Archive -Path .\dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release -DestinationPath .\dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release.zip -Force
   ```

## Running the Application

### Method 1: Run the Clean Distribution (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the `dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release` directory
2. Double-click `DeploymentAnalyzer.bat` to start the application

### Method 2: Run the Standard Distribution

Navigate to the `dist\DeploymentAnalyzer` directory and run `DeploymentAnalyzer.exe`.

### Method 3: Use the Debug Launcher

Run `debug_DeploymentAnalyzer.bat` from the project root directory to launch with debug output.

## Distribution Structures

### Clean Distribution Structure (DeploymentAnalyzer-Release)

```
DeploymentAnalyzer-Release/
├── DeploymentAnalyzer.exe       # Visible launcher (ONLY this and README should be visible)
├── README.txt                   # Visible documentation
└── .app/                        # Hidden application folder
    ├── lib/                     # Application executables and libraries
    │   ├── DeploymentAnalyzer.exe
    │   ├── app_config.ini
    │   └── ...                  # All DLLs and other files are hidden here
    └── support/                 # User data folders
        ├── data/
        ├── logs/
        └── output/
```

IMPORTANT: The final release should ONLY have the DeploymentAnalyzer.exe and README.txt files visible in the top-level directory. All other files including DLLs should be hidden inside the .app folder for a clean user experience.

### Standard Distribution Structure (DeploymentAnalyzer)

```
DeploymentAnalyzer/
├── DeploymentAnalyzer.exe       # Main executable
├── README.txt                   # Documentation
├── data/                        # Data directory
├── logs/                        # Logs directory
├── output/                      # Output directory
└── ...                          # Other application files
```

## Troubleshooting

### If the Application Won't Start

1. **Check log files**:
   - For clean distribution: Check for log files in `.app\support\logs`
   - Look for `app_output.log` and `app_error.log` in the project root
   - Check for `launcher.log` and `launcher_error.log` in the logs directory

2. **Verify file structure**:
   - For clean distribution: Make sure the `.app` folder exists alongside the launcher
   - Make sure required directories exist (data, logs, output)
   - Ensure all necessary files are included in the build

3. **System-specific issues**:
   - Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable if you see "Missing DLL" errors
   - Temporarily disable antivirus software which may block execution

4. **Manual debugging**:
   - For clean distribution, run the VBS script directly to see error messages:
     ```
     cscript //nologo DeploymentAnalyzer.vbs
     ```
   - For standard distribution, run the executable from Command Prompt:
     ```
     cd dist\DeploymentAnalyzer
     DeploymentAnalyzer.exe
     ```

5. **Check for Python module structure issues**:
   - The most common issue is that the `_internal` directory containing Python modules is not properly copied
   - Ensure that the directory structure in the release follows: `.app\lib\_internal\` containing all Python modules
   - Use the `fix_release.bat` script which explicitly handles this structure

6. **Issues with the EXE launcher**:
   - If the C# compiled launcher fails to work, use one of these alternatives:
     - Create a shortcut-based launcher using `create_launcher.bat`
     - Directly copy the VBS file as an EXE (less ideal but functional):
       ```
       copy "dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release\DeploymentAnalyzer.vbs" "dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release\DeploymentAnalyzer.exe"
       ```

### Known Issues and Solutions

1. **File Not Found Errors**:
   - Check if data files are properly bundled with the executable
   - Make sure all required directories exist

2. **Module Import Errors**:
   - If you get missing module errors, add them to the build command:
     ```
     pyinstaller --hidden-import=missing_module ...
     ```

3. **Permission Errors**:
   - Run as administrator if the application needs elevated permissions
   - Check if the application has write permissions to its directories

4. **Missing DLLs**:
   - If Python DLLs are missing, use the enhanced build script:
     ```
     .\enhanced_build.bat
     ```
   - This explicitly includes Python and Visual C++ runtime DLLs

5. **Large Distribution Size**:
   - The build now automatically excludes large CSV files and test directories
   - If the distribution is still too large, consider removing more files using the patterns in `enhanced_build.bat`
   - You can run a post-build cleanup using PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     Get-ChildItem -Path "dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release" -Recurse -Force -Include *.csv | Remove-Item -Force
     ```

## Distributing the Application

1. **Clean Distribution (Recommended)**:
   - Copy the entire `dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-Release` directory
   - Users will only see two files (DeploymentAnalyzer.exe and README.txt)
   - Provides a clean, professional appearance

2. **Standard Directory Distribution**:
   - Copy the entire `dist\DeploymentAnalyzer` directory
   - Include README.md with usage instructions

3. **Single-file Distribution**:
   - Distribute the single .exe file from the `dist` directory
   - Create a zip file with the .exe and any required documentation

4. **Creating an Installer**:
   - Consider using InnoSetup or NSIS to create a proper installer
   - Include Visual C++ redistributables if needed

## Building Distribution Variants

The project includes several scripts to create different distribution variants:

- `build.bat` - Standard PyInstaller build
- `enhanced_build.bat` - Enhanced build with explicit DLL inclusion and CSV exclusion
- `create_final_release.bat` - Creates the clean distribution
- `reorganize_dist.bat` - Reorganizes standard distribution with lib/support folders
- `create_minimal_distribution.bat` - Creates a minimal distribution variant
- `update_release_with_exe.bat` - Updates an existing release with an EXE launcher and cleans up unnecessary files

## Optimizing Distribution Size

The distribution size has been optimized by:

1. **Excluding test files and directories**:
   - All test directories from libraries are excluded
   - This saves approximately 21 MB

2. **Excluding large sample data CSV files**:
   - Files like `Editorial_Importzeit*.csv` are excluded
   - This can save hundreds of MB depending on the size of your data files

3. **Excluding other unnecessary components**:
   - Sample data directories from libraries
   - Documentation files that aren't needed for runtime
   - Debug symbols and compile artifacts

To verify the exclusion worked, check the final distribution size - it should be approximately 330-350 MB (down from 600+ MB).

## Testing Deployment

Always test the application on a clean system (or virtual machine) that resembles the target environment before distributing to end users.
