# Image Distribution Analysis

A tool for analyzing the distribution timing of images from reception to publication. This tool provides both a simple command-line script for quick analysis and a more interactive dashboard for deeper exploration.

## Features

- **Data Import**: Import image data from CSV files into a SQLite database
- **Basic Analysis**: Generate heatmaps showing processing delays by weekday and hour
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Explore data with an interactive web-based dashboard
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns or outliers in processing times

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ deployment-analyse.py      # Simple analysis script (single file)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                       # Source code directory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cli.py                 # Command-line interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ run_dashboard.py       # Dashboard runner script

```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Quick Analysis with deployment-analyse.py

For a simple analysis that generates a heatmap of processing delays:

```bash
python deployment-analyse.py --file your_data.xlsx --output heatmap.png
```

This will:
- Read your Excel file
- Calculate processing delays
- Generate a heatmap showing average delays by weekday and hour
- Display basic statistics in the console

### Full Analysis with Interactive Dashboard

For more detailed analysis:

1. Import your data into the database:

```bash
python src/cli.py import --file your_data.csv --db-path db/image_distribution.db --store
```

2. Run the interactive dashboard:

```bash
python src/run_dashboard.py --db-path db/image_distribution.db
```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:8050`

## Dashboard Features

The simplified dashboard provides:

- **Core Statistics**: Total records, average/min/max processing delays
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Processing delays by weekday and hour
- **Advanced Analysis**: Expandable section with timeline analysis and anomaly detection
- **Export Options**: Save visualizations as PNG or data as CSV

## CSV Format Requirements

Your CSV file should include the following columns:
- `bildankunft_timestamp`: When the image was received
- `onlinestellung_timestamp`: When the image was published
- `processing_delay_minutes`: Delay between reception and publication

Additional columns will be stored but are not required for analysis.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter module import errors, ensure you've installed all dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that the database directory exists: `mkdir -p db`
- For Windows users, use backslashes in file paths: `python src\run_dashboard.py --db-path db\image_distribution.db`

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- dash
- dash-bootstrap-components
- SQLite3 (built into Python)
