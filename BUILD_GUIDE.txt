DEPLOYMENT ANALYZER - QUICK BUILD GUIDE
======================================================

This guide provides quick instructions for building the Deployment Analyzer application.
For detailed instructions, please see DEPLOYMENT.md.

PREREQUISITES:
-------------
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Required packages (install with 'pip install -r requirements.txt')
- PowerShell (recommended) or Command Prompt

QUICK BUILD STEPS:
----------------
1. Update version information (if needed):
   Open 'version.py' and update VERSION_MAJOR, VERSION_MINOR, VERSION_PATCH,
   and VERSION_DATE variables.

2. Clean previous builds:
   PowerShell: Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -Path build, dist, *.spec
   CMD: rmdir /s /q build dist & del *.spec

3. Build the application:
   Run: .\ultimate_build.bat

4. Create versioned release:
   Run: .\create_versioned_release.bat
   
   This will:
   - Extract version number from version.py
   - Create a properly named folder (DeploymentAnalyzer-{VERSION}-Release)
   - Create a clean user interface with only EXE and README visible
   - Hide all application files in the .app folder

5. Test the application:
   Run: .\dist\DeploymentAnalyzer-{VERSION}-Release\DeploymentAnalyzer.exe

TROUBLESHOOTING:
--------------
- If the application fails to start, check log files in .app\support\logs
- For build issues, see the "Troubleshooting" section in DEPLOYMENT.md
- If EXE launcher doesn't work, try installing .NET Framework or Visual Studio with C# tools
